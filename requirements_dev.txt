# The following reasons we dont use git for data management
# Storage size : File size is huge of size GB, TB and even petabyte. Also, github will reject push if data file is > 25MB
# Conflict resolution : Source code management is done in SVC, github. Merge conflict for millions of data set is unmanagable
# Performance - Git push is very slow, it may fail during push. 
# Hence git is not used for data management. Instead use DVC.
# DVC for data version control
